    "For Assignment 1, I implemented move_zeros_to_end(nums) with a single forward scan using a while loop. My idea was to keep the operation in-place and preserve the original order of non-zero elements (stability). Whenever I encountered a zero at index i, I removed it with pop(i) and immediately pushed it to the end with append, while not advancing i (because a new element slid into position i). When I saw a non-zero, I incremented i. I also tracked n (the effective boundary for scanning) and decreased it after moving a zero, so the loop only processed each position until all non-zeros had been “compacted” to the front. This approach was easy to reason about and required O(1) extra space, but I learned that repeated middle pop(i) operations make the worst-case time O(n²) (e.g., many zeros near the front). I validated behavior on edge cases—empty list, all zeros, no zeros, and mixed values—and confirmed that stability holds. If I were to optimize further, I’d switch to the two-pointer write-index method for O(n) time while still being in-place. I’d also document assumptions (e.g., False == 0, 0.0 == 0) and note that the function mutates the input list."
